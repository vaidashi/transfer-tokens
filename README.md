# Defi Experiment with Solidity

This project is a full stack app I used to experiment with Solidity and allowing a transfer of tokens between one user and another. The front end is written with React and Material UI. 



Running the app:

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

Grab a couple of the private keys and addresses after running the above, needed for importing into wallet for testing transfer functionality on client. I have Metamask as by wallet, but other providers would suffice. 

```shell
npm run deploy localhost
npm start
```
